# 😎Problems It Solves

-> Firstly, there aren't many group-based chatroom services where individuals can have deep conversations on any topic. Every service mainly focuses on one-to-one chat. We got your back here!!

-> Secondly, in all the services, where we can talk to strangers, the distance between the users becomes a huge factor in building real life connections. We got you covered here too :D

Connect comes with a location filter, where you will meet people within the specified radius. 

It's up to you, to meet people in the neighbourhood or across the globe, haha :)

-> You get to show the real you here, through meaningful conversations, and build real connections.
